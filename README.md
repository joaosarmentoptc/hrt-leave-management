   - EndDate
   - Reason
   - Status (Pending, Approved, Rejected)
   - ManagerID (Foreign Key from Users)
   - HRID (Foreign Key from Users)

3. **LeaveBalances**: Tracks leave balances for employees.

   - BalanceID (Primary Key)
   - EmployeeID (Foreign Key from Users)
   - LeaveType

4. **LeavePolicies**: Stores leave policies based on country.
   - PolicyID (Primary Key)

2. **Leave Requests**:

   - POST `/leave-requests`: Submit a new leave request.
   - GET `/leave-requests`: View leave requests (with filters for status, date range, etc.).
   - PUT `/leave-requests/{id}`: Update leave request status (approve/reject).

3. **Leave Balances**:

   - GET `/leave-balances`: View leave balances.
   - PUT `/leave-balances/{id}`: Update leave balances (HR only).

4. **Leave Policies**:
   - GET `/leave-policies`: View leave policies.
   - POST `/leave-policies`: Create new leave policy (HR only).
   - PUT `/leave-policies/{id}`: Update leave policy (HR only).

## Step 4: Develop the Frontend

### Technology Stack:

## Step 5: Implement Notifications

- **Email Service**: Use services like SendGrid or SMTP server to send email notifications.
- **Notifications**: Trigger emails on leave request submission, approval, rejection, and reminders.

## Step 6: Testing

- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components and functions.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the integration between components and the entire workflow.
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Allow end-users to test the system and provide feedback.

## Step 7: Deployment

- **Hosting**: Choose a hosting service like AWS, Azure, or Heroku.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up continuous integration and deployment pipeline for smooth updates.

## Step 8: Documentation and Training

- **User Manual**: Create a detailed user manual for employees, managers, and HR.
- **Training Sessions**: Conduct training sessions to familiarize users with the system.
